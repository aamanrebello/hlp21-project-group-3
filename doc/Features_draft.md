### Adding Symbols

### Selecting Symbols
- May be done by: clicking on a symbol or dragging a box over multiple symbols.

### Deleting Selected Symbols
- May be done via drop-down menu or by pressing the 'delete' key.
- Deleting a symbol deletes all connected wires and wire error messages.

### Moving Selected Symbols
- May be for a single symbol or for a group. Done by dragging a mouse (moving with left button down) so that selected symbols follow. *Automatic snapping to grid*.

### Transforming Symbols
- **Rotation** - Can be done for selected symbol via drop-down menu or via shortcuts: Ctrl-E for clockwise and Ctrl-Q for anticlockwise rotation. Wire routing automatically adjusts.
- **Scaling** - Interactive scaling by dragging from corner of selected/non-delected symbol. Selected symbol(s) can also be scaled up/down by 1.25 via drop down menu or shortcuts: ALt-M (maginfy), ALt-D (diminish).
- *All transformed symbols automatically snap to grid**.

### Aligning Selected Symbol Groups
- May be done via drop-down menu or shortcuts: *Alt-X* for alignment along X-direction (horizontal); *Alt-Y* along Y-direction (vertical). Horizontally aligned symbols cannot be vertically aligned and vice versa.
