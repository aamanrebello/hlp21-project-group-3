Demo outline

1. Different symbols
    I will have symbols of each general category created in the init for the demo, so will be displayed on startup.
2. Symbol selection (& Mouse events can select symbols)
    Click/drag symbol -> Symbol will be selected/highlighted
3. Port highlight
    Move cursor near symbol -> Ports will be highlighted
4. Rotate symbol
    Select a symbol -> Press alt+shift+R to show rotation functionality works
5. Scale symbol
    Select a symbol -> Press alt+shift+U to scale up by 1.25, alt+shift+D to scale down by 0.85 in both x and y directions, to show scale functionality works.
6. Delete symbol
    Select a symbol -> Press delete, symbol will be removed.
7. Move ports manually
    I cannot show this in the build demo but I will show the code/message that I have written that will achieve this
