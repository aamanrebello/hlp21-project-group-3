# README for BusWire Demo: gr1518

## Add Wires
- Dragging from port to port auto routes a wire between these ports

## Highlight Wires
 - Wires can be selected by clicking on them or dragging highlight box to cover the entire wire(s)
 - Second click unhighlights wire 
 - 
## Delete Wires
 - Highlighted Wires can be deleted by pressing delete

## Width Annotation
  - Wires of width 1 are red and above 1 are purple and have a corressponding annoation to indicate width.

## Routing and Movement of Wires
 - Moving symbols re-autoroutes the wires so wires are updated accordingly
 - Current auto-routing implements basic obastacle avoiding but works best when inputs port (dest port) is right of outport port (src port). This is a bug that   will be fixed in group stage.
