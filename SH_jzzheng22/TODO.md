2. HIGHLIGHTPORTS NEEDS TO HIGHLIGHT WHEN CLOSE TO SYMBOL, NOT JUST INSIDE SYMBOL
3. TODO: MAKE SURE TARGET PORT IS INVERSE OF SOURCE PORT
4. Clean up code
5. Extra functionality
    - CtrlC CtrlV

6. Clicking up multiple times when doing multi select isn't working. Works for first click down but second click down only selects the component you clicked on, not all the ones that were selected
